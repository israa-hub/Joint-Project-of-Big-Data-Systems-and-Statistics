# 📊 Statistics + 🗃️ Database Coursework Projects  
### 📚 University Projects – Statistics & Database Modules

These projects were completed during my **third year** of the **BSc in Mathematics and Data Science** at **Dundalk Institute of Technology**, as part of the continuous assessments for the **Statistics (20%)** and **Database Systems (35%)** modules. The projects involved analysing real-world datasets and managing structured data through database design and queries.

---

## 📦 Project Overview

- The **Statistics project** focused on data cleaning, exploratory analysis, regression modeling, and insights derived from energy and temperature datasets using **R and R Markdown**.
- The **Database project** aimed to design and query a database system using either **MongoDB** or **SQL**, demonstrating a solid understanding of schema design, data ingestion, and practical queries.

## 📁 Project Structure

| File Name | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `JLHome1718Power1.csv` | CSV | Raw dataset containing power usage readings from a home energy monitor. |
| `JLHome1718Temperature1.csv` | CSV | Raw temperature data associated with the power consumption period. |
| `stats_final_merged_data.csv` | CSV | Cleaned and merged dataset used for the final analysis. |
| `r markdown.Rmd` | RMD File | Full R Markdown analysis including cleaning, plotting, statistical modeling, and insights. |
| `joint_project_israa.docx` | Word Doc | Final written report (~2000–4000 words) documenting methodology, results, and interpretations for the Statistics module. |

*Note: Database files (ERD, ingestion script, queries, or slides) were submitted separately as instructed during the Database Systems module class.*
