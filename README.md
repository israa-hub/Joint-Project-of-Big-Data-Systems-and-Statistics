# Joint Project of Big Data Systems and Statistics


### 📚 University Projects – Statistics & Big Data Systems Modules

These projects were completed during my **third year** of the **BSc in Mathematics and Data Science** at **Dundalk Institute of Technology**, as part of the continuous assessments for the **Statistics** and **Database Systems** modules. The projects involved analysing real-world datasets and managing structured data through database design and queries.

---

## 📦 Project Overview

- The **Statistics project** focused on data cleaning, exploratory analysis, regression modeling, and insights derived from energy and temperature datasets using **R Markdown**.
- The **Database project** aimed to design and query a database system using either **MongoDB** or **SQL**, demonstrating a solid understanding of schema design, data ingestion, and practical queries.

## 📁 Project Structure

| File Name | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `JLHome1718Power1.csv` | CSV | contains data from 12-10-17 to 13-10-19. This data measures the power usage in watts and each entry indicates the total usage over the previous minute. |
| `JLHome1718Temperature1.csv` | CSV | contains data from 12-10-17 to 13-10-19. This data measures the temperature of the house in degrees Celsius and each entry indicates the average temperature of the house over the previous 5 minutes. |
| `hourly_dublin_17_18_19 ` | CSV | contains weather data from Dublin Airport from 1-1-17 to 31-12-19. The weather data is recorded every hour. |
| `KeyHourly.txt ` | CSV | contains information about the columns that are in the hourly_dublin_17_18_19 file. |
| `r markdown.Rmd` | RMD File | Full R Markdown analysis including cleaning, plotting, statistical modeling, and insights. |
| `stats_final_merged_data.csv` | CSV | Cleaned and merged dataset used for the final analysis. |
| `joint_project_israa.docx` | Word Doc | Final written report documenting methodology, results, and interpretations for the Statistics module. |
| `queries.txt` | Text Doc | Contains all queries of SQL and MongoDB used to store and analyse the data. |
